Expected changes: 
--------------------------------------------------------------


Please note the following points while designing registration procedure:
1) in registration procedure group leader will be just adding roll number and names of group members..
2) project topic, guide details addition will be done later on edit project info page...
3) project title approval will be done by project coordinator so it's like a temporary token initially after checking with previous 3year list
4)guide allotment will be done like a request response from student leader to favulty...
Or project title can be made as an assignment...
Just like a form field entry... normally we give a deadline for it...
But make sure there is edit rights for project title edit title later on also..as it can be updated later stage also...
